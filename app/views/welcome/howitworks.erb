                    <h4>What is UmVox?</h4>

                    <p>UmVox is a collective feedback system, which relies on the community to submit their comments (Vox means voice in Latin; so let your Vox be heard!)</p>

                    <p>Once you file a vox, the UmVox team will contact the addressee on your behalf. The days of endlessly waiting for a customer service representative to get back to you are over. Once the addressee responds, you will be notified immediately.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="itemTwo">
                    <h4>Create a Vox</h4>

                    <p>Sharing your voice is the first step in creating a community. First, give your Vox a clear and concise title. The best practice is to focus on the facts and leave out the frustration.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="itemThree">
                    <h4>Follow-up</h4>

                    <p>The UmVox Team will immediately make contact with the addressee and share your Vox with them. The UmVox Team will notify you as soon as the addressee responds. You may check the status of posted Voxes on your user dashboard.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="itemFour">
                    <h4>Resolve your Vox</h4>

                    <p>Be sure to resolve your Vox and write a brief description of what happened in your case. Your description will help other users in similar situations know what took place and that the Umvox Team is doing its job.</p>
