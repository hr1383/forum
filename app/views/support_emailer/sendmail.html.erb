  Below are the details of your vox #12345:
Bad delivery service
Driver placed (3) parcels by side door, in snow, directly in front of door. Had to go out front door
to get to the packages as the door would not open without knocking top parcels off. Did not
knock or ring bell and I was sitting directly in front of picture window, next to front door - with
larger, snow cleared porch - had I not seen truck leaving I would not have even looked out that
door to get parcels after dark.
I do realize that drivers are on a tight schedule but would have been much simpler to just come
to front door - I was waiting for delivery and would have opened door by the time the driver
arrived.
I am 71 years old and am disgusted with the decrease in services - prices go up and quality of
service decreases.
